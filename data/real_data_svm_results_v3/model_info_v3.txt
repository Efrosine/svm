Apple Disease Detection Model Information (v3)
===========================================

Date: 2025-05-07 02:46:32

Dataset Information:
- Training samples: 13 (only correctly classified samples)
- Test samples: 7 (from correctly classified samples CSV)
- Features: Scaled Texture Regularity, Scaled Lesion Density

Feature Processing:
- Using pre-scaled features from correctly classified samples
- No additional scaling or feature extraction needed

Best SVM Configuration:
- learning_rate: 0.001
- lambda_param: 0.001
- n_iterations: 1500
- C: 5.0

Test Accuracy: 100.00%

Notes:
- Using only correctly classified samples provides better feature separation
- This approach leads to more reliable classification boundaries
